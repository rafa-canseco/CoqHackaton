# CardGame Smart Contract

## Description

A Solidity smart contract for a card game that leverages Chainlink VRF for randomness and OpenZeppelin contracts for secure ERC20 token betting and access control. The contract includes a dual taxation system where a portion of the game pot is taxed, with part being burned and part sent to the developer's wallet to fund ongoing development.

## Features

- ERC20 token betting
- Chainlink VRF for provably fair card shuffling
- OpenZeppelin's Ownable for secure access control
- Card game logic based on suits and values
- Dual taxation system with burn and development fund
- Emergency withdrawal function for contract owner

## How to Play

1. Players bet ERC20 tokens to enter the game.
2. The game commences once four players have entered.
3. Chainlink VRF is used to shuffle the deck, ensuring fair play.
4. Players' positions advance when they draw cards matching their assigned suit.
5. The winner is awarded the pot, after taxes have been deducted.

## Taxation System

Upon the conclusion of a game, the contract applies a taxation system to the pot:

- A 12% burn tax is permanently removed from circulation, which can contribute to the deflationary aspect of the game's economy.
- A 3% development tax is allocated to the developer's wallet, supporting future improvements and sustainability of the game.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```shell
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts@4.7.3
npm install @chainlink/contracts@0.4.0
```
2. Deploy the contract using tools like Truffle, Hardhat, or Remix.

## Usage

- `enterGame(uint256 amount)`: Enter the game by betting ERC20 tokens.
- `setTax(uint256 burnTax, uint256 devTax)`: Set the burn and development tax rates (onlyOwner).
- `emergencyWithdraw()`: Allows the owner to withdraw funds in case of emergency.

## Events

- `GameEnded`: Emitted when the game concludes and a player wins.
- `TaxBurned`: Emitted when the burn tax is applied.
 transferred to the developer's wallet.
- `EmergencyWithdrawal`: Emitted when the owner performs an emergency withdrawal.
